Your lyrics, visible and valuable.


## News

Currently the development of GUI is still at an early stage. The architecture of GUI may change any time, so I won't make it open-sourced at this time. The source code will be available as soon as I release the first public beta version.

Now I have only implemented the Karaoke lyrics mode and very basic i18n support. See demo picture below.
